Spook
-----

Spook is a markdown blog with a Ghost-like theme for the very lazy blogger. 

# Installation

Clone the repository. Run `composer install` and edit `config.php`. 

Create posts in `posts/` in the format of `2014-12-28-my-blog-post-title.md`

A post should have a jekyll-like front matter. An example post would look like:

    -----
    title: My blog post title!
    date: 2014-12-28
    tags: something, stuff
